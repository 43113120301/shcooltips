<p>There are five playable characters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rina Tamaki</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(girl)</li>
<li><strong>Taiga Yuki<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>(boy)</li>
<li><strong>Yuta Aida</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(little boy)</li>
<li><strong>Mio Aida</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(little girl)</li>
<li><strong>Cat Butler</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Robot</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s step into the world of Sakura School. Starting off, unless you choose to become any of the other playable characters, you&rsquo;ll start off as the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>teenage girl<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and spawn in front of her house. From there you can go to the school or look around, as there is much to see in this game.&nbsp;</p>
