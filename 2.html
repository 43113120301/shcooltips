<span>Each match starts out with your character leaving home, but you can take them anywhere you wish. Run all over Sakura Town as you please, talk to tons of different characters, visit their homes, and do anything you want. Are you game for visiting one of your classmates? Go ahead. Or conversely, would you prefer to wreck havoc in your town? That's all up to you.</span>
