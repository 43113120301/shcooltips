<p>What to cause some mayhem? Go to the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Yakuza office</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(there are two men wearing black clothes walking outside it). Kill all the members, and go up to the two-door and kill the other members. Then to the doors on your left and kill the leader. You will find in the building<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>4guns, 1 sword</strong>, and<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>7000 yen</strong>. Also remember that if you don&rsquo;t kill the members, or even die, they will keep following and attacking.&nbsp;</p>
