<p>You can earn money by<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>befriending</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>the NPCs like the old man from your school, the salesman from Sukuma corp, random drivers (try to steal their car and if they try to run, go after them and throw compliments to avoid getting reported) those 3 NPCs would give you money ranging from 1k to 2k Yen. After befriending them, you can select the option<em><span>&nbsp;</span>give me some money</em><span>&nbsp;</span>located at the talk button. But make sure to keep the status of your relationship<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>up</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or they<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>will not<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>give you money.</p>
